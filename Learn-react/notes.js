every element which are created by react is considered as a js object.

NOTE:- JSX is a type of syntax which looks like a html syntax but it is not a that.
JSX is a way to creating a react elements.
And converting jsx to react element is done by a bable package.

FLOW:- JSX element => react.createElement=> react Object()=> HTML element(render)

/*
Functional Components:- A normal javascript function which can return the element is basically called as a functional components.
it can be called using <componentName/>  or using {JS function invoke}.
and we can write the normal javascript syntax in the functional components using {}.
It is imporatant to start the name of functional components by capital letter.
